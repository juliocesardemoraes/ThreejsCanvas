## THREEJSCanvas

In this project I created a canvas for rendering all my threejs projects. It's a simple way to showcase them.


## Setup

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
